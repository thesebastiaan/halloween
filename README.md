# halloween

Very basic script to play a video file from a directory of mp4's on a Raspberry PI using Omxplayer. Omxplayer does not require a GUI. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/omxplayer.md

Script has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2b, 3b and 4b.

Of course you don't have to use this for Halloween, but that's what I used it for :) Specifically with the awesome, albeit slightly pricey videos from https://atmosfx.com
